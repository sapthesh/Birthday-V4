Welcome to Birthday V4, a premium, narrative-driven birthday web experience. This version is a complete departure from previous designs, focusing on a light, modern "glassmorphism" aesthetic and a highly creative, multi-step storybook reveal. It's designed to be a memorable and enchanting digital gift.

## ‚ú® V4 Features

* **Elegant & Modern Design:** A beautiful, light-themed design featuring soft pastel colors and "frosted glass" UI elements.
* **Dynamic Animated Background:** A gently shifting gradient background combined with subtle floating light particles creates a dreamy, magical atmosphere.
* **Five-Step Narrative Journey:** Takes the user on a story-like adventure:
    1.  **The Mysterious Gift:** Begins with an elegantly wrapped gift box.
    2.  **The Golden Key:** Unveils an animated key to unlock the next stage.
    3.  **The Magical Storybook:** The key unlocks a stunning 3D CSS storybook.
    4.  **Animated Page Turning:** The book opens and pages turn automatically, revealing short, sweet messages.
    5.  **The Grand Finale:** The final page transitions to a beautiful card with animated floral elements.
* **Advanced CSS & SVG Animations:**
    * **3D Page-Turning Effect:** Built with CSS 3D transforms for a realistic feel.
    * **SVG Path Animation:** The key and final floral designs are animated to "draw" themselves on screen.
* **Enchanting Music:** A new, royalty-free music track that complements the magical theme.
* **Fully Responsive:** The entire experience, including the complex 3D animations, is designed to work beautifully on all devices.
